# Chat AI
This is a simple chatbot project built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which utilizes OpenAI's text-davinci-003 API engine to generate responses to user input. The chatbot's design is minimalist and is represented by a floating widget that can be toggled open or closed. Users can input text messages which are then sent to the API, and the chatbot generates a response which is displayed on the chat window. The chatbot's responses are continuously improving over time as it learns from user interactions.

# Installation
To run the chatbot, simply download the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files and open the HTML file in your preferred web browser.

# Usage
To use the chatbot, simply click on the chat widget to open the chat window. You can input text messages in the chat input field and press enter or click the send button to send your message. The chatbot will then generate a response which will be displayed on the chat window.

# API Key
The chatbot uses OpenAI's text-davinci-003 API engine to generate responses. To use the API, you will need to obtain an API key from OpenAI. You can sign up for an API key on the OpenAI website: https://beta.openai.com/signup/

Once you have obtained an API key, replace the OPENAI_API_KEY variable in the JavaScript file with your API key.
