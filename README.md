# Openai-chatbot
This is a chatbot built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript that uses OpenAI's text-davinci-003 API engine to generate responses. It has a minimalist design and a floating widget that can be toggled open or closed. Users input messages, the API generates a response, and it's displayed in the chat window.
